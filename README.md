**Your guide to implementing next-generation generative adversarial networks**

## What is this book about?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized the fields of machine learning and deep learning. This book will be your first step towards understanding GAN architectures and tackling the challenges involved in training them.


This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Learn how GANs work and the advantages and challenges of working with them
* Control the output of GANs with the help of conditional GANs, using embedding and space manipulation
* Apply GANs to computer vision, NLP, and audio processing
* Understand how to implement progressive growing of GANs
* Use GANs for image synthesis and speech enhancement

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.utils import np_utils
from keras.optimizers import SGD
from keras.layers.core import Dense,Activation
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for machine learning practitioners, deep learning researchers, and AI enthusiasts who are looking for a perfect mix of theory and hands-on content in order to implement GANs using Keras. Working knowledge of Python is expected.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
